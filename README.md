## Analytics with Spreadsheets program on Udacity Project


In this project I was tasked with analyzing data from over 500 companies on the New York Stock Exchange. In task 1 I was asked to use picot tables and graphs to come up with and extract insights from the dataset. For task 2 I was asked to create a profit and loss statement consisting of four years worth of data with a dropdown so that it could quickly pull information for any of the companies included. For task 3 I expanded on the P&L sheet to include forecasting for the next two years based on three different market scenarios. I used statistics and google sheets to clean and analyze the data, as well as to create the interactive dashboard.
